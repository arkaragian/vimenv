# Installation
This repo can be cloned in the appropriate locations. More specifically
this can be used in the nvim folder located
## For Windows
```
~/AppData/Local/nvim
```

In addition some 3rd party tools must be installed and be set up at specific paths. The path
that I choose to install those to is
```
%USERPROFILE%/bin
```
Those tools are:
1. For C#
    1. Omnisharp-roslyn used for lsp services
    1. netcoredbg from samsung that is used for dap debugging

Additional languages will be added as I continue to experiment with the neovim config
